EX: 1

FILES:
Makefile - Including a 'clear' and 'tar' commands for the files.
osm.cpp  - The implemented functions.

ANSWERS:

Assignment 1:
	- The program creates a new directory "Welcome/To".
	- The program opens a file in the directory named "OS2021".
	- The program gets the status of the file.
	- The program writes a massage in the file about the course guidelines.
	- The program closes and delete the file and delete the directories.
	- The program closes all related threads.

Assignment 2:
    As we learned in class, by viewing the graph we are able to conclude
    that using a VM is much more tasking, and it requires a lot more recourses.
    Running directly on the machine of using a container will minimize the time
    for every kind of operation.
